JPLY BBS
is a Bulletin Board System
which is means to simulate what BBSes
where like in the late 80s.
It is a resurrection of
§Night NAK BBS§ form the
late 80s in Mexico city.
The SysOp has poured his
heart and soul into this BBS.
it is supposed to inspire
nostalgia in those who used BBSes
and teach the younger generations
what telecommunications were
like before teh Internet.


NOTE: this is still a work in progress, 

Please stay around and enjoy
your experience!
