JPLY BBS
is a Bulletin Board System
which is means to simulate what BBSs
where like in the late 80s.
It is a resurrection of
§Night NAK BBS§ form the
late 80s in Mexico city.
The SysOp has poured his
heart and soul into this BBS.
it is supposed to inspire
nostalgia in those who used BBSs
and teach the younger generations
what telecommunications were
like before the Internet.

Please stay around and enjoy
your experience!
